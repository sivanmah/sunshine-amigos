## Structure
**BEM**
BEM stands for Block Element Modifier, and is a methodology that helps with reusing and sharing your code.
Basically, BEM is a simple and powerful naming convention that is very useful for front-end coding.
The block represents a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. The element is a part of the block that does nothing by itself, but is tied to the block.
The modifier is a flag on a block or element. It used to change their appearance or behavior.
So an example of a block could be header, while an element could be header title, and a modifier could be hidden.
So a hidden modifier of the element header title would be named as: .header__title--hidden 
With the use of BEM, working together on our project will become a much smoother experience, as it will be easier to understand what each name stands for.
