                <p>I met a child a year ago
                whose eyes would never see.</p>
                <p>She asked me with a timid smile,
                "What colour is a tree?"</p>

                <p>"In summertime a tree is green;
                In autumn gold and red;</p>
                <p>In winter they are frosted white
                when all their leaves are shed."</p>

                <p>I know the sky is blue," she said.
                "And silver is the sand;</p>
                <p>And apples are the brightest red.
                What colour is a man?"</p>

                <p>Man is many colours child:
                Some are yellow, some are brown.</p>
                <p>And some are black as sightlessness,
                Some white as eiderdown."</p>

                And placed them in my glove</p>
                <p>And said, "By mixing all of these
                Comes my favourite colour--love."</p>
